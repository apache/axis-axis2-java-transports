        <section name="Introduction">The SMS Transport will allow send and receive
            messages in the form of SMSs used in mobile phones.Using this transport
            the users will be able to invoke webservices using a SMS and get the
            responce.SMS Transport is mainly focus on enableing SMPP protocal support
            for the Axis2 so that It can connect with a SMSC to send/receive SMS.It
            will also have a GSM implimentation that will enable users to connect a
            GSM modem and send/receive sms s using that.The configuration parameters
            will be different depend on the implimentaion that the user will be using
            (SMPP/ GSM) Follwoing up section will be discuss more details about the
            configuration ,usage and Extenting of the SMS Transport

                When using the SMPP
                implimentaiton It will connect with a SMSC (Short Message Service center)
                and Listening to the incomming messsages on a TCP connection.This
                implimentaion can be used when the data traffic is so high.

        <section name="Extending SMS Transport">The SMS Transport is Designed to
            be extended to use with Other SMS implementations as well.It has two
            logical layers one is the SMS Layer which has all Axis2 dependent code and
            Other one is The Implementation layer which only contain the
            implementation logic related to the specific implimentation.So the
            Developers who need to write a another implementation can reuse the SMS
            layer and focus oly about thire implementation logic.
            <subsection
                    name="SMSMessageBuilder">SMSMessageBuilder determines the message format
                that Axis2 accepting from the incoming SMS.In the Default
                SMSMessageBuilder implementation its supported for the RPC type SMS format
                for the incoming SMS to invoke a Webservice its :<b>

                    "Parameter_1=value_1":......:"Parameter_N=value_N"</b>.Developers can add
                another Builder to accept another formats by implementing the
                SMSMessageBuilder interface and Specifying it as a Parameter in the
                TransportListener

                formats the out put SMS Message Form the Axis2 MessageContext.Developers
                can Add a custom MessageFormatter by Implementing the SMSMessageFormatter
                interface and Specifying it as a Parameter in the TransportSender.

                    name="Implimentation">SMS Trasnport also allows Developers to add another
                SMS implementations to the SMS Transport.To Add a another Implementation
                It should have an Implementation manager that implements the
                SMSImplManager interface.In that Implementation Developers can add their
                custom implementation logic without worring about the Axis2
                Dependensies.To add a Implementation Manager It must be Specified as a
                parameter in Transport Receiver and sender
